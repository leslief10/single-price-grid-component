## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Grid is a pretty cool way to put everything where I want on the page. I think I'm slightly obsess with it.

### Continued development

I need to learn a bit more about Responsive Design. I'm not entirely sure my projects are fully responsive, even with the use of media queries. I'll need to read a bit more about it.
